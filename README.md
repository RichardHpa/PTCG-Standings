#### I found a bug

This is a personal project and I am the only one working on it. I have tested it as much as I can, but I am only human. If you find a bug, please let me know. You can either open an issue on the [github page](https://github.com/RichardHpa/Pokemon-TCG-Standings) or contact me on [X](https://twitter.com/RichardHpaNZ) (which I have barely used). The more information you can provide, the better (screenshots are great). I imagine there will be a lot of bugs to begin with and I will try to fix them as soon as I can.

The most common error that I have seen is to do with the API and not being able to get a response. If you see that then it is likely just a network error and hopefully a page refresh will fix it.
