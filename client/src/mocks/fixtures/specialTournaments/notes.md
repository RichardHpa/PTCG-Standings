These are tournaments that seem to have something special about them that we need to test for

#### Duplicate Player Names

For the Indianapolis Pokémon TCG Regional Championship 2024 (0000121) there are two Juniors players with the same name and from the same country (Nathan S [US]). Since this is how we identify players, we need to make sure that we can handle this case.

#### juniorsseniors

For the 2023 Bogotá TCG Special Event (0000082) there wasn't enough juniors and seniors players to have separate tournaments, so they were combined into one. We need to make sure that we can handle this case.

### worlds2024

Since we have special pages for the worlds tournaments, we need to make sure that we can handle them correctly. This is the 2024 Pokémon TCG World Championships (0000128).
